# COL216 Assignment 2 Autograder

## Running Submissions
TODO


## Pipeline Simulator
1. After all submissions are run, the pipeline outputs will be in the directory `<pipeline_outputs>`. This directory will contain a sub-directory for each testcase. Each testcase directory contains a directory for each submission. Each submission output directory contains 4 files for each of the parts.
2. The gold outputs are in the directory `<gold>`. This contains a sub-directory for each test case. Each sub-directory contains three files `5_nobypass`, `5_bypass` and `79`, containing the outputs for each of them.
3. To run the pipeline simulator, run the following command:
```
$ ./pipeline_checker <gold> <pipeline_outputs> <csv output directory>
```

## Branch Predictor Simulator
1. After all submissions are run, the branch predictor outputs will be in the directory `<branch_outputs>`. This directory will contain a sub-directory for each testcase. Each testcase directory contains a directory for each submission. Each submission output directory contains 12 files - 3 different predictors each initialised with 4 different values.
2. To run the branch predictor simulator, run the following command:
```
$ ./branch_checker <branch_outputs> <testcase_directory> <csv output directory>
```
